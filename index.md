I am a last year Ph.D. student working on graph theory under the supervision of [Christophe Paul](https://www.lirmm.fr/~paul/) and [Dimitrios M. Thilikos](https://www.lirmm.fr/~thilikosto/).



I am currently interested in studying the approximate behaviour of graph parameters via their universal obstructions with respect to some particular quasi-ordering on graphs.
